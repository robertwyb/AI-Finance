Read dfP_RegressionChannelSimple.xlsx, and
compare it with RegressionChannelSimple.py which was covered in this presentation.

Read dfP_moving_average_crossover_simple.xlsx, and
compare it with moving_average_crossover_simple_incomplete.py
You will notice that we wrote some comments with instructions for you to write code.
Please write the missing lines.
You will not get exactly the same result by the Python program
as the Excel spreadsheet but it should be close 
(there is a difference in Excel and Python date processing functions that 
results in a difference in the number of years that affects the results).


As guidance:
Use the Spyder variable explorer.
Use the CheatSheets included in the materials for this session:
Miscellaneous\CheatSheets\NumpyPandasMatplotlib.pdf
Miscellaneous\CheatSheets\CheatSheetPandasDataFrameMarkGraph.pdf

What to turn in:
Just turn in the script (moving_average_crossover_simple_incomplete.py) with the missing lines filled in and all the data needed to run it (the script), all in a folder, zipped, with your name on the zip file name as per instructions.
